# 🏀 Fullcourt-AI

AI-powered tools to help draft and manage competitive fantasy basketball teams.  
This project is my personal effort to experiment with prompt engineering, AI models, and basketball analytics to gain an edge in my **NFBKC fantasy basketball leagues**.

---

## 📌 Purpose
The goal of **Fullcourt-AI** is to explore how artificial intelligence can:
- Assist in **draft-day decision making**.
- Generate **start/sit recommendations**.
- Analyze **projections and matchups**.
- Learn from **historical draft and season results**.

This is primarily a learning and experimentation project for applying AI to real-world use cases in fantasy sports.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)
- [ ] Custom AI prompts for draft assistance.  
- [ ] Integration with fantasy basketball projections and stats.  
- [ ] Simulation of draft scenarios.  
- [ ] Tools for lineup optimization during the season.
