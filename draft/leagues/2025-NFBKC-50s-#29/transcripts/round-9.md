what is the latest fantasy news regarding jalen suggs.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
Here’s the latest:

Suggs is rehabbing from March knee surgery (arthroscopic procedure with mosaicplasty on the left knee) that ended his 2024-25 season. The team has consistently framed his recovery as on track for a full return. 
Reuters

He’s been held out of early preseason action and is targeting Opening Night later this month; reports note he’s doing non-contact work and may not play in preseason games. 
CBSSports.com

Orlando added Tyus Jones, who started a preseason game while Suggs ramps up, but depth charts still project Suggs as the starting PG when healthy. Expect some early-season minute/usage management. 
Orlando Magic Daily
+1

Fantasy take: treat him as a steals-first guard with a small early-season ramp. If you draft him around the 100s, pair with a safe assists source in case his minutes/role build gradually through October.

## Notes
I drafted Jalen Suggs to address my needs for steals.  Will focus on stocks as I fill out the rest of my roster.  I need rebounds, blocks and steals.

## Issues
None the thinking model made a huge difference.
