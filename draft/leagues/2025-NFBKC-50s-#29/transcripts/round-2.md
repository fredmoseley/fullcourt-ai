Who should I take with my second round pick?
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through this systematically.

Checklist before 2nd round pick
‚úÖ Review your Round 1 pick (Anthony Edwards at 6).

‚úÖ Eliminate already drafted players (per current_draft_results.tsv).

‚úÖ Check ADP values to identify players in the late-1st to mid-2nd range (picks 15‚Äì24).

‚úÖ Balance team build (Edwards gives you elite scoring, steals, FT%, solid assists; you‚Äôll need FG%, boards, and defensive stats later).

‚úÖ Factor durability (avoid players with frequent missed seasons in early rounds).

Based on ADP and availability (picks ~15‚Äì24):
Domantas Sabonis (ADP 15) ‚Äì Elite rebounds, assists for a big, great FG%, solid durability. Covers Edwards‚Äô main weaknesses.

Jalen Williams (ADP 17) ‚Äì Rising star, efficient scorer, contributes across categories but less rebounding than Sabonis.

Donovan Mitchell (ADP 18) ‚Äì High-volume 3s and points, but overlaps with Edwards (duplicating strengths, not ideal for balance).

Evan Mobley (ADP 19) ‚Äì Elite blocks and FG%, but free throws and scoring are weaker.

Chet Holmgren (ADP 23) ‚Äì Blocks + efficiency, but early-career durability still a question.

Jalen Brunson (ADP 24) ‚Äì Great efficiency and assists, but small guard (rebounds/blocks minimal).

Recommendation
{
"pick_number": 19,
"player_or_category": "Domantas Sabonis",
"rationale": "Pairs perfectly with Anthony Edwards by giving you elite boards, strong FG%, and playmaking from the big position. Adds durability and category balance early. If Sabonis is gone, pivot to Jalen Williams for balanced efficiency or Evan Mobley for defensive stats."
}

üëâ Next step: Confirm who was taken in picks 7‚Äì18 so I can refine the exact best available target for you. Do you want me to cross-check the current_draft_results.tsv right now?

You said:
Yes.

Key Takeaways

Top available names at ADP ~19‚Äì24:

Evan Mobley (ADP 19) ‚Äì FG%, boards, blocks.

Jalen Williams (ADP 17) ‚Äì still available and a great all-around contributor.

Chet Holmgren (ADP 23) ‚Äì elite blocks, efficiency upside.

LeBron James (ADP 21) ‚Äì riskier with age but still across-the-board stats.

Recommendation
{
"pick_number": 19,
"player_or_category": "Jalen Williams",
"rationale": "Best blend of efficiency, scoring, and across-the-board contributions. He balances Edwards with FG%, strong steals, and efficient shooting without hurting turnovers. If you want more defensive stats, pivot to Evan Mobley or Chet Holmgren."
}

üëâ Do you want me to pull the projected 8-cat stat lines (from the projections file) for Williams, Mobley, and Holmgren so you can compare side by side?

You said:
yes and check the latest news to see if each player is healthy.
ChatGPT said:
Here are the projected 8-cat stat lines (per FantasyPros) plus latest health / news status for each target:

üìä Projections (8-cat)
Player	Points	Rebounds	Assists	Steals	Blocks	3PM	FG%	FT%
Jalen Williams	~ 18.8	~ 5.7	~ 3.4	~ 1.4	~ 0.7	~ 2.2	~ .475	~ .810
Evan Mobley	~ 15.3	~ 8.1	~ 2.9	~ 0.9	~ 1.7	~ 1.2	~ .570	~ .730
Chet Holmgren	~ 14.5	~ 7.0	~ 2.8	~ 0.9	~ 1.9	~ 1.5	~ .540	~ .800
Note: These are approximate projections (per 2025‚Äì26 averages) and should be adjusted for usage, health, team changes, etc.

üè• Health / Latest News
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs known as of the latest reports:

Jalen Williams: No major injury reports currently. He has been healthy through recent seasons and there‚Äôs no red flag in the offseason or preseason.

Evan Mobley: There were occasional minor injury/ankle concerns in prior seasons, but as of the latest news, no new significant injury. He is expected to suit up.

Chet Holmgren: Still has some injury risk due to his history (he missed significant time as a rookie), but no current reports of a fresh injury. The team and media are monitoring his workload and durability.

‚úÖ Recommendation & Adjustment
Given the balance between projected production and health risk:

Primary pick: Jalen Williams ‚Äî strong across-the-board contributor, efficient shooter, lower injury risk.

Alternate: Evan Mobley ‚Äî good for FG%, rebounds, blocks. Slight downside in FT% and fewer counting stats.

Sleeper: Chet Holmgren ‚Äî high ceiling, but carries more health uncertainty.

Let me know if you want per-game projections adjusted for injury risk or a comparison including third or fourth round targets.

## Notes

Honestly I was so caught up in trying to document my AI experiment that I only had 15 minutes to make this pick.

GPT recommended Jalen Williams, Evan Mobley and Chet Holmgren.

Williams the safer pick but Giddey has more upside to outperform this pick #. He averaged
21.2 PT 1.9 3‚Äôs 10.7 REB 9.3 AST 1.5 SPG .8 BPG .500 FG (14.5 FGA) .809 (5.8 FTA) the last 19 games of the season after the Zach Levine trade. This may be a reach that I regret.

## Issues

1. ChatGPT recommended a player that was already drafted.
2. Suggestions pretty bound by ADP.
