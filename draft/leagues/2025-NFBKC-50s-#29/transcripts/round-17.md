Who was the last person drafted in the current_draft_results.tsv

ChatGPT said:
I can’t read current_draft_results.tsv right now—the file search index returned no matches for it in this project, so I can’t verify the last drafted player. If you re-sync that file (or upload the PDF backup you mentioned), I’ll pull the final row immediately. If it’s easier, paste the last 5 lines here and I’ll confirm the most recent pick.

Try to reload the current_draft_results.tsv file again.

## Notes

Assists specialists.

## Issues

-   This project is still struggling with the tsv. Maybe I should try csv.
