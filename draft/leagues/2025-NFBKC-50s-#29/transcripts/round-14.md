Reload the current_draft_results.tsv.  Who was the last person drafted?

Thought for 58s
ChatGPT said:
I reloaded the file: the last player drafted is Cam Whitmore — Round 14, Pick 160 (Team: @Danellmer27, Pos: F).

You said:
reload the nfbc_adp.tsv.  Let me know if you are able to parse this file.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 27s
Yes—I successfully reloaded and parsed nfbc_adp.tsv.

Rows: 334

Columns: ADP, Player, Team, Position(s), Min Pick, Max Pick

Example top entries: Jokic (ADP 1), Wembanyama (2), SGA (3).

I’m ready to use this file with your ±12 ADP window and cross-check against current_draft_results.tsv for the next pick.

You said:
We are in the 14th round of this draft what should my strategy be at this point of the draft?

"pick_number": 162,
"checklist": [
"Use + parse current_draft_results.tsv to exclude anyone already taken and confirm round/pick context.",
"Use nfbc_adp.tsv (±12 around pick 162 → ~150–174) to anchor value and anticipate who won’t make it back.",
"Scan rotowire-nba-projections.csv for 8-cat fit (AST/STL for guards; 3s+STOCKS for Fs; efficient bigs).",
"Prioritize Forward scarcity until 4 Forwards are secured; also add early-season availability to offset Garland/Edey early absences.",
"Cross-check sleeper/bounce-back PDFs for upside flags at this range (guard/forward/center sleepers, breakout/bounce-back lists)."
],
"decision_process": [
"Round 14 = value grabs + category specialists (no TO in 8-cat).",
"Team context: need bankable early minutes and either AST+STL (guard) or 3s+STOCKS (forward).",
"Filter to ADP 150–174; remove players already drafted.",
"Deprioritize chronic low-games risks this early-late tier unless upside is material.",
"Prefer players likely to be drafted before your next turn (won’t get back) and who fit category needs."
],
"recommendations": [
{
"player_or_category": "Santi Aldama (F/C)",
"adp": 168,
"rationale": "Forward-eligible stretch big who supplies 3s with some BLK/STL; provides early-minute insurance if JJJ/Edey sit at times. Fits late-round F scarcity and shores up 3s/STOCKS from a big."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Marcus Smart (G)",
"adp": 155,
"rationale": "Targets your stated need: ~5 AST with 1.3+ STL profile, plus threes. Role-secure, contributes immediately while Garland ramps up."
},
{
"player_or_category": "T.J. McConnell (G)",
"adp": 171,
"rationale": "Elite late AST source with positive STL and FG% for a guard; perfect glue pick to buoy assists in October if Garland misses time."
},

"player_or_category": "Bilal Coulibaly (G/F)",
"adp": 162,
"rationale": "Upside ‘stocks’ wing (1.1–1.3 STL, ~0.7–0.9 BLK potential) with improving 3PT. Helps you chase defensive categories from a Forward slot."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Dyson Daniels (G)",
"adp": 164,
"rationale": "Combo guard with 1.5+ STL upside and ~4–5 AST when minutes are stable; low-usage helper who won’t hurt percentages."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Patrick Williams (F)",

You said:
resync both the current_draft_results.tsv and nfbc_adp.tsv files.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 26s
All set — I re-synced both files and parsed them successfully.

current_draft_results.tsv: 300 rows, columns = Round, Pick, Player, Position, Team, Duration, YTD
Last 3 drafted:

Ryan Kalkbrenner — Round 14, Pick 158 (C, Team: 50-5)

Kyshawn George — Round 14, Pick 159 (G, Team: Draft29)

Cam Whitmore — Round 14, Pick 160 (F, Team: @Danellmer27)

nfbc_adp.tsv: 334 rows, columns = ADP, Player, Team, Position(s), Min Pick, Max Pick

Ready to proceed with Round 14 recommendations using your ±12 ADP window and excluding all drafted players.

You said:
Extend your draft window to ±36.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — I’ll use an ADP window of ±36 around your pick going forward (expanding to ±72 at turns/positional scarcity if needed). Ready to apply this to Round 14.

{
"pick_number": 162,
"checklist": [
"Purpose: cross-reference current_draft_results.tsv (availability) + nfbc_adp.tsv (value window ±36 → ADP 126–198) + rotowire-nba-projections.csv (category fit: AST/STL, 3PM, STOCKS). Minimal inputs: current round/pick, undrafted player pool, ADP, projections.",
"Re-scan current_draft_results.tsv to exclude all drafted names (last logged pick: 160 Cam Whitmore).",
"Filter nfbc_adp.tsv to ADP 126–198 and remove drafted players.",
"From projections, flag guards ≈5 AST and ≥1.0 STL; add wings with 3s+STOCKS and forwards that don’t tank FT%.",
"Balance roster: you’re strong at F/C; emphasize assists/steals and early availability while Garland ramps.",
"Anticipate snipe risk using Min/Max Pick to order targets (those with earlier Max Pick get bumped).",
"Validate: confirm recommendations align with 12-team, 8-cat roto (no TO) and your scarcity rule (F prioritized only if tie)."
],
"decision_process": [
"Your next pick is ~162; window extended to ±36 (126–198).",
"Primary need: add assists/steals from a guard; secondary: wings with 3s+STOCKS who fit FT%.",
"Deprioritize additional traditional Cs given current depth; keep any bigs to stretch 3s/BLK without FT% harm.",
"Order picks by: (1) category fit, (2) won’t-make-it-back risk via ADP range, (3) upside/role stability.",
"If a top value appears (e.g., veteran starter inside the window), allow exception even if not a perfect category fit."
],
"recommendations": [
{
"player_or_category": "Tyus Jones (G, ORL)",
"adp": 198,
"rationale": "Best category fit at this stage: ~5.0 AST with ~1.0 STL and solid 3PT. Stabilizes assists while Garland ramps. ADP suggests he may slide, but if AST is the priority, take him now and remove a late-round headache."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Keon Ellis (G, SAC)",
"adp": 171,
"rationale": "Elite ‘stocks’ guard/wing (≈1.55 STL, ≈0.86 BLK with ~2 threes). Low-usage glue who boosts STL/BLK/3PM without hurting FT%. Role expanded late last year; strong fit for defensive counters."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Khris Middleton (F, WAS)",
"adp": 175,
"rationale": "Forward with guard-like contributions (≈3.6 AST, good FT%, ~1.5 threes). If healthy, he’s a rare late forward who helps dimes without punting efficiency; useful given F scarcity rule on ties."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Jerami Grant (F, POR)",
"adp": 176,
"rationale": "Across-the-board wing: ~2.1 AST, ~0.75 STL/BLK, ~2.2 threes with strong FT%. Safe volume minutes; adds 3s and light stocks while preserving percentages."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Kyle Kuzma (F, MIL)",
"adp": 167,
"rationale": "Points/3s/boards (~3.3 AST as a bonus). Not a steals ace, but a late scoring bump with some playmaking to offset Garland’s early absence."
},

"player_or_category": "Taylor Hendricks (F, UTH)",
"adp": 170,
"rationale": "Upside ‘stocks’ forward (~0.94 STL/~1.06 BLK, 1.6 3PM). If minutes hold, he’s a late swing who can move you in BLK without killing FT%."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Grayson Allen (G, PHO)",
"adp": 178,
"rationale": "Category specialist: 3s with excellent ratios (low TO irrelevant in 8-cat). Not an AST/STL fix, but a reliable late stabilizer for 3PT%/3PM if guards with assists are sniped."
}
],
"warnings": [
"If any listed player appears in current_draft_results.tsv between now and pick 162, skip to the next name.",
"Some ADP entries (e.g., veteran stars) may look unusual; picks reflect exactly what’s in your nfbc_adp.tsv after filtering to undrafted players.",
"If assists are secured earlier (e.g., Tyus goes), pivot to Ellis/Hendricks for STL+BLK or Middleton/Grant for balanced wing stats."

{
"player_or_category": "Walter Clayton (G, UTA)",
"adp": 192,
"rationale": "Projects ≈2.5 AST with solid FT%; guard depth gives him a path to 18–24 mpg early. More of a streaming-friendly rookie who can cover shortfalls when Garland ramps."

{
"player_or_category": "Jeremiah Fears (G, NOR) — deep fallback",
"adp": 250,

## Notes

I prety much knew I wanted Kuzma at this point. Rotowire thinks he has some bounce back appeal. Strictly a backup. He can fill in if Jaren Jackson or Paul George misses time.

## Refinements
