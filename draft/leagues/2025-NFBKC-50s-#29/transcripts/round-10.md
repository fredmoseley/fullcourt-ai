Who should I draft in Round 10?

"Prioritized wings/forwards who add stocks and efficient 3s; kept one C-upside option.",
"Favored players with stable roles or projected starts and positive Max Pick ≥114.",

],
"decision_process": [
"Your stated goal favors specialists (stocks + reb + ast) over ‘mid’ balance.",
"Edey (ADP ~99) being available at 114 is a clear value fall for REB/BLK.",
"Weigh FT% downside + rookie volatility vs. elite category juice.",
"Avoid redundancy: if taking Edey, Aldama drops in priority due to role overlap on MEM.",

Take him over PG/Podz/Aldama only if you’re comfortable with rookie C variance or leaning into a soft FT% punt. Adaptation: if a big run starts before 114, bump Missi to #3 as a contingency for blocks."
},
{
"player_or_category": "George, Paul",

## Notes
Drafted Zach Edey because I need more boards and blocks.  He may miss the first 2 weeks of the season.  Target Santi Aldama in the 11th round since I own both Edey and Jaren Jackson.   Aldama will play more when Edey or Jaren Jackson are out.  I need to fill in for Garland.  Worst case scenario Lonzo?
