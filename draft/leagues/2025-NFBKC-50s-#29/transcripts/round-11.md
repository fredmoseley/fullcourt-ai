ChatGPT said:
Awesome—thanks for the update! I’ll follow your new instructions and use the latest files going forward.

Want me to do a quick refresh now and report (1) the last 3 players drafted from current_draft_results.tsv, (2) the best values in your current ADP window from nfbc_adp.tsv, and (3) immediate targets based on rotowire-nba-projections.csv + sleeper/bounceback PDFs?

## Notes
Neither Aldama or Mitch were available.
I updated the GPT context to use rotowire paid projections.
GPT recommend: Paul George, Brandin Podziemski, T.J. McConnell
I couldn’t stomach the George pick.  Like with Embiid Philly may air on the side of caution with George as their goal is having him healthy for the playoffs. Plus he was bad when he played last year.
