I have updated the rotowire-nba-projections.csv and attached the current_draft_results.tsv.  Who should I draft in Round 19.

Thought for 1m 18s

{
"pick_number": 223,
"checklist": [
"Use current_draft_results.tsv to exclude already-drafted names; use rotowire-nba-projections.csv + depth charts/sleeper PDFs for role + category fit; essential inputs: latest draft board, player minutes/ratios (FGM/FGA, FTM/FTA), and roster needs (AST/FT%/3PM/stocks).",
"Scan Round 19 ADP window conceptually (late-round ±36) for falling value; flag any obvious value drops (ADP null if file unavailable).",
"Prioritize specialists that boost AST/3PM/FT% or stocks without hurting FG%/TO (8-cat, no TO).",
"Prefer multi-position Forwards only if comparable in value (Forward scarcity tie-breaker).",
"Check depth-chart path to minutes and opening-month opportunity to reduce stash risk."
],
"decision_process": [
"Our build leans toward adding AST/3PM/FT% or stocks; avoid FG% hits.",
"Late-round targets must have a clear role (opening-night minutes, bench path, or injury hedge).",
"From sleepers/Depth Charts, surface guards/wings with usage or defensive-event upside.",
"Cross-check for any previously drafted names (cannot verify via tool this turn—see warnings).",
"List 4–6 options with distinct category boosts plus contingency pivots if one is sniped."

{
"player_or_category": "Payton Pritchard",
"adp": null,
"rationale": "Late-round assists + 3PM with strong FT% and a projected Boston backcourt role alongside Derrick White; usage buoyed while Tatum is out and frontcourt is thin. Solid floor as an AST/3PM glue piece in Round 19.  "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Jaylen Wells",
"adp": null,
"rationale": "3-and-D wing with a real path to 25–30 minutes on Memphis; helps 3PM with some steals, low turnovers, and fits as a late glue guy with upside if scoring ticks up.  "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Aaron Nesmith",
"adp": null,
"rationale": "Elite efficiency (FG/FT/3PT) plus 3PM/steal trickle; Pacers’ wing minutes should be there and he scales with opportunity—perfect 8-cat stabilizer if your FT% needs a late boost. "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Neemias Queta",
"adp": null,
"rationale": "If you prefer stocks/FG% late: viable BOS center path with Porziņģis/Kornet gone; per-minute boards/blocks and elite FG%—a clean FG%/REB/BLK specialist. Pair with your 3-point guards.  "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Kevin Porter Jr.",
"adp": null,
"rationale": "If you want upside assists + 3s in one pick: realistic chance to start at PG in MIL; late-round top-75 ceiling case if minutes stick. Mind some FG% variance.  "
}
],
"warnings": [
"current_draft_results.tsv was attached but not readable via the tool in this turn; I cannot auto-exclude drafted names—please cross-check availability before locking in.",
"nfbc_adp.tsv not accessible this turn; ADP values are set to null. I honored a late-round ±36 conceptual window based on typical market ranges.",
"If any of the above names are already drafted on your board, pivot to similar profiles: steals guard (Alex Caruso), upside AST (T.J. McConnell), or FG%/BLK big (Neemias Queta if not taken) per the same logic."

"adp": null,
"rationale": "Versatile big who can chip in 3s/REB with occasional STL/BLK; role expands whenever JJJ sits or if MEM leans big. Late-round, multi-cat stability that plays well in roto. Adaptation: If you’re already strong in REB/FG%, pivot to a 3s/FT% wing like Hauser.  "

"adp": null,
"rationale": "Endgame 3-point specialist who could see ~30 mpg given Boston’s thin frontcourt; stacks 3s with strong FT% and low TOs—ideal roto backfill if you’re light on triples. Adaptation: If he’s rostered or Boston adds a big, slide to Nesmith/Wells for steadier all-around lines.  "

"checklist": [
"Reason for file use + inputs: Reloaded current_draft_results.tsv to exclude drafted players; used nfbc_adp.tsv for market context and rotowire-nba-projections.csv for category impact; inputs needed: undrafted pool, ADP (±36 of pick 223), and your team’s category needs (AST/3PM/FT% without harming FT%).",
"Confirm all @kfredincali picks and open roster flexibility (G/F/C/UTIL) from the draft board.",
"Filter projections to undrafted players only; compute per-game category boosts (AST/3PM/FT%, steals/blocks) and note efficiency (FG%, FT%).",
"Apply late-round ADP window (187–259) and bump clear role/efficiency fits even if ADP slightly outside range.",
"Prioritize clean roto fits (3PM/FT%/STL or stocks) with stable minutes paths; avoid one-category sinkholes."
],
"decision_process": [
"Your Round 18 Isiah Joe gave you 3PM; this pick should either add assists/steals without hurting FT% or grab a low-risk efficiency wing.",
"Pulled undrafted names with ADP in 187–259; cross-checked each versus projections for 3PM, FT%, and either AST or STL/BLK.",
"Preferred players who keep FT% afloat (≥~78–80%) and avoid big FG% hits.",
"Included one upside F/C for ‘stocks + 3s’ diversity if you want a different build lever.",
"Anticipated snipes: if the top name goes, pivot to the next closest archetype (noted below).",
"Validation: All options are undrafted at 223, within/near the ADP window, and improve at least one of AST/3PM/FT%/stocks while respecting an 8-cat roto build."

"adp": 208,
"rationale": "Balanced guard for late rounds: ~2.79 AST, ~1.83 3PM, ~0.92 STL with FT% ~78.2. Slightly lighter FT% than KCP but adds a bit more playmaking. Adaptation: If you want more steals ceiling, pivot to Marcus Smart; if you want purer FT%/3s, stick with KCP."
},

"player_or_category": "Marcus Smart",
"adp": 212,
"rationale": "Category needle for steals (~1.13) with ~2.83 AST and ~1.1 3PM. FT% (~75) is the one minor tradeoff; still a strong late pick if you want defensive events and some assists. Adaptation: If FT% is too tight, avoid Smart and pick KCP instead."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Noah Clowney",
"adp": 221,
"rationale": "Upside F for stocks + floor spacing per projections (blocks + 3s blend) while keeping FT% (~81.6) viable. Good late pivot if you’d like another path to BLK without punting shooting. Adaptation: If you prefer a steadier role, choose KCP/NAW over Clowney."
},
{
"player_or_category": "Anthony Black",
"adp": 232,
"rationale": "If you want more assists from this slot: ~3.36 AST, ~1.2 STL, respectable shooting volume. FT% (~75.9) isn’t ideal, so only select if you’re comfortable with your current FT% buffer. Adaptation: If FT% is a concern, prefer KCP or NAW."
