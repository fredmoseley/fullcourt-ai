You said:
Who should I take with my first pick?

ChatGPT said:
Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d approach your first overall pick in a 12-team, 8-cat roto draft:

Checklist
Confirm elite per-game production across all 8 categories.

Prioritize durability (65+ games in at least 2 of last 3 seasons).

Anchor FG%, FT%, rebounds, assists, and defensive stats early.

Avoid players with major injury risk in Round 1.

Ensure flexibility in roster construction (multi-pos eligibility is a bonus).

Recommendation
{
  "pick_number": 1,
  "player_or_category": "Nikola Jokic",
  "rationale": "Jokic is the clear #1 pick in roto. He has the best blend of efficiency (FG% and FT%), elite rebounds, assists from the center spot, and strong steals/blocks with low turnovers. Heâ€™s also extremely durable, playing 65+ games in 3 of the last 4 seasons. Starting with Jokic gives you a foundation in every category and maximum roster flexibility."
}
Next adjustment if Jokic is off the board: Victor Wembanyama is the #2 ADP and offers elite blocks with scoring upside, but carries higher durability risk. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the safest alternative after Jokic, anchoring elite scoring, FT%, assists, and steals.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also rank out the next 3 best fallback options after Jokic for your first pick?

You have ignored the context that I have provided in my instructions. The current_draft_results.tsv contains the draft results to date.  It will tell you what players have been taken so far.  I cannot draft a player that has already been taken.  My team name is @kfredinccali.  I have the 6th pick in the first round.

Got it â€” thanks for pointing that out. Letâ€™s reset with the correct draft context:

Draft Results so far (Round 1, Picks 1â€“5):
Nikola Jokic

Victor Wembanyama

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Luka Doncic

Cade Cunningham

You (@kfredincali) are on the clock at Pick 6.

Checklist for Pick 6
Jokic, Wemby, SGA, Luka, and Cade are gone.

Identify the best blend of durability + elite category contributions.

Avoid high-injury risk (e.g., Embiid) in Round 1.

Target a cornerstone who can anchor multiple roto categories.

Build with flexibility for future balance (donâ€™t pigeonhole into punting yet).

Recommendation for Pick 6
{
  "pick_number": 6,
  "player_or_category": "Anthony Edwards",
  "rationale": "With the top 5 gone, Edwards is the best option. Heâ€™s an ascending superstar, durable (played 79 and 82 games last two years), and delivers strong points, threes, steals, and improving efficiency. He anchors guard scoring while leaving room to balance assists and rebounds in later rounds."
}
Alternatives if you prefer different roster builds:
Anthony Davis â€“ Elite FG%, rebounds, and blocks, but bigger durability risk.

Karl-Anthony Towns â€“ Safer durability than AD, contributes threes, rebounds, and efficiency.

Trae Young â€“ FT%, assists, and scoring anchor, but more one-dimensional.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also project how your category strengths/weaknesses will look if you start with Anthony Edwards vs Anthony Davis vs Towns? 

You said:
Give me a table with the projected stats of Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and Trae Young.
ChatGPT said:
Projected Stats Comparison


I pulled the FantasyPros projections â€” hereâ€™s a table comparing Anthony Edwards, Trae Young, and Karl-Anthony Towns across 8-cat roto stats.

Would you like me to break down which categories each player gives you an edge in so you can see how your team would be shaped by each pick?

## Notes
I donâ€™t love his FG% but he is a young star on the rise that has not reached his prime yet.  Offers MVP upside.  This was an easy pick

## Issues
ChatGPT recommended a player that was already drafted.
