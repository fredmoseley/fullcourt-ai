"Cross-check depth/roles with rotowire_projected_starters.pdf and rotowire_depth_chart.pdf to avoid traps (role/minutes risk).",
"Layer in upside from sleepers/bouncebacks PDFs (guards/forwards/centers; breakout list) to prioritize late-round ceiling.",
"Validate category fit vs. team needs (stocks = STL+BLK, REB, AST) and maintain Forward priority when choices are equal."
],
"decision_process": [
"Your build already has Edwards, Randle, JJJ, Garland, Podziemski, Ware, Edey, Paul George; you asked to lean stocks/reb/ast.",
"Round 13 is value-hunting: target wings for 3s+stocks or bigs for FG%/REB/BLK, plus one guard for AST if starting.",
"Prefer players with secure roles per depth charts and projected starters; downgrade shaky rotations.",
"Surface late-round upside from sleepers/breakouts that match needs.",
"Stage contingency pivots if a target is sniped before your pick."

{
"player_or_category": "Jaylen Wells",

"rationale": "3-and-D wing with a clear path to minutes after Bane’s departure; projects starters’ minutes and >2 threes with some steals—fits 3s/STL without killing %s. (See sleeper forward + breakout writeups and depth chart showing Wells as starting SF in MEM.) "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Aaron Nesmith",
"adp": -1,
"rationale": "Elite efficiency glue wing (50/43/91 last year) poised for more minutes with Turner gone and Haliburton out; helps 3PT%, 3PM, and chip-in stocks without turnovers. Great roto fit. "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Kevin Porter Jr.",
"adp": -1,
"rationale": "Milwaukee’s PG job is open; KPJ’s usage spikes without Dame and he can give AST with 1.0+ STL and some 3s—late-round guard who addresses assists without punting stocks. Depth chart/projects support real minutes. "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Neemias Queta",
"adp": -1,
"rationale": "Classic FG%/REB/BLK flier if you want a C: Boston’s frontcourt is thin; Queta’s per-minute rim protection scales if he sticks as the starter—perfect late ‘stocks + FG%’ add. "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Sam Hauser",
"adp": -1,
"rationale": "If you want to lean harder into 3s with good FT% and neutral TOs, Hauser’s path to ~30 mpg is open in Boston’s thin forward room; low-risk way to boost 3PM. "
},
{
"player_or_category": "Category: Assists + Steals (Guard bench flier: Payton Pritchard)",
"adp": -1,
"rationale": "If you specifically need AST insurance while Garland ramps, Pritchard is viable with Boston’s depth thinned; cheap assists with solid 3s and passable steals. Use only if your C/wing targets are gone. "

"Scanned ADP window 115–187 and filtered to undrafted names only.",
"Cross-referenced rotowire-nba-projections.csv for projected stocks (STL+BLK), REB, AST, and efficiency to match your specialist focus.",

"adp": 135,

},
{
"player_or_category": "Ayo Dosunmu",
"adp": 169,

"player_or_category": "Jaylen Wells",
"adp": 160,
"rationale": "Late 3s infusion (~2.3 3PM in projections) with decent %s and a path to starter minutes; helps 3s/PTS without turnovers. If you prefer more stocks, choose Coulibaly/Dunn instead."

"player_or_category": "Kelly Oubre",

## Notes
I decided to prioritize a stable replacement for Paul George.  Though his stats are not a match to replace George.
