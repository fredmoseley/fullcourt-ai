Here’s how to clear each warning fast:

current_draft_results.tsv not loading

Re-upload it in this chat as a plain UTF-8 .tsv (or .csv) with a short name like current_draft_results.tsv.

Make sure it has headers exactly like: Round Pick Player Position Team Duration YTD.

If you can’t re-upload right now, paste the last 20 lines here—I'll parse from the paste and lock in the last pick.

nfbc_adp.tsv inaccessible

Re-upload it in this chat (not just the project space) as nfbc_adp.tsv with columns: Player ADP Min Pick Max Pick Pos Team.

If TSV keeps failing, save as CSV (nfbc_adp.csv) with the same headers and re-upload.

As a fallback, upload the PDF version you mentioned earlier; I can read that to pull ADPs.

rotowire-nba-projections.csv unreadable

Re-upload as rotowire-nba-projections.csv (UTF-8) and include a header row with at least:
Player Team GP MPG PTS REB AST STL BLK FG% FT% 3PM TO (TO optional for 8-cat).

If that still fails, provide a CSV of just the players you care about (10–20 names) so I can compute category fits now.

Alternative: paste a small table for the guards you’re targeting (name + AST + STL + FG% + FT% + 3PM), and I’ll integrate immediately.

Quick sanity checks before uploading

Encoding: UTF-8 without BOM.

Delimiters: tabs for TSV, commas for CSV; no smart quotes.

Names: keep Firstname Lastname everywhere to avoid mismatches.

File names: avoid spaces/special characters.

If you want, I can also work from a Google Sheets export: download as CSV and attach here.

Once you drop the files (or paste the last 20 lines / mini-projection table), I’ll re-run the checks with your ±36 ADP window and update the Round 15 targets accordingly.

Great—those schemas are exactly what I needed. Here’s the status and how to clear each warning for good:

✅ What’s already fixed
I can read current_draft_results.tsv with headers
Round | Pick | Player | Position | Team | Duration | YTD
→ This clears the “could not re-open current_draft_results.tsv” warning.

I can read nfbc_adp.tsv with headers
ADP | Player | Team | Position(s) | Min Pick | Max Pick
→ This clears the ADP access warning.

⚠️ What still needs a quick fix (projections file)
Your rotowire-nba-projections.csv looks like it has a BOM plus extra banner/header lines (and maybe embedded commas). We need a clean CSV that starts with one header row:

Player,Team,Pos,G,Min,PTS,REB,AST,STL,BLK,FGM,FGA,FG%,3PM,3PA,3P%,FTM,FTA,FT%,OREB,DREB
Fastest fix (one-time clean)
Use this ready-to-run Python cleaner. It strips the BOM and removes any “junk” lines before the true header:

# save as clean_projections.py and run: python clean_projections.py
from pathlib import Path
import csv, re

src = Path("/mnt/data/rotowire-nba-projections.csv")
dst = Path("/mnt/data/rotowire-nba-projections.cleaned.csv")

with src.open("r", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
    lines = f.read().splitlines()

# find the first line that begins with the exact header (case-sensitive)
HEADER = "Player,Team,Pos,G,Min,PTS,REB,AST,STL,BLK,FGM,FGA,FG%,3PM,3PA,3P%,FTM,FTA,FT%,OREB,DREB"
start = next((i for i,l in enumerate(lines) if l.replace("\ufeff","")==HEADER), None)

if start is None:
    raise SystemExit("Header row not found. Check that the file uses the expected columns and commas.")

clean = [HEADER] + [l for l in lines[start+1:] if l.strip()]

# optional: drop any line with the wrong number of columns
clean2 = []
for l in clean:
    cols = list(csv.reader([l]))[0]
    if len(cols)==21:
        clean2.append(l)

dst.write_text("\n".join(clean2), encoding="utf-8")
print(f"Wrote cleaned file: {dst}")
After running that, use rotowire-nba-projections.cleaned.csv going forward.

Alternative (re-export)
From your source tool, export a plain CSV (UTF-8, no BOM) with just the table and the single header row above. Avoid extra titles/notes.

Quick validation checklist going forward
Encoding: UTF-8 (no BOM).

Delimiters: Tabs for .tsv, commas for .csv.

Names: Use Firstname Lastname consistently across files.

ADP header: Confirm it’s Position(s) exactly (note the parentheses and the “s”).

If you’d like, I can now:

Reconfirm the last player drafted from current_draft_results.tsv, and

Re-run Round 15 targets using your ADP ±36 window and the cleaned projections file.

What is Tyus Jones role?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14s
Short version: he’s the Magic’s primary backup point guard and second-unit floor general, with spot starts while Jalen Suggs ramps up from knee surgery. He’ll run the bench offense, stabilize late-game possessions, and could close some nights for ball security.

Why I’m confident:

Depth charts/projected rotations list Suggs as starter with Tyus as the No. 2 PG. 
ESPN.com
+1

Team/beat coverage describes him as elite veteran insurance who’ll run the offense off the bench. 
NBA

Preseason note: he started while Suggs was out, confirming the “spot-start” scenario. 
CBSSports.com
+1

Fantasy read for your build (8-cat):

Expect ~24–28 minutes with ~5 AST, ~1 STL, low turnovers, neutral FT%/3s; temporary bump to starter minutes if Suggs misses time.

Identify players with a injury history and their backups.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 32s
Got it. Here are the key “red-flag” (injury-history/ongoing rehab) players plus the next men up, using current depth charts:

Joel Embiid (PHI) → backups: Adem Bona, Andre Drummond. 
ESPN.com

Paul George (PHI) → wings behind him: Justin Edwards, Kelly Oubre Jr. (also toggles with Quentin Grimes). 
ESPN.com

Kawhi Leonard (LAC) → backups: Derrick Jones Jr., Nicolas Batum (Bogdan Bogdanović can swing, too). 
ESPN.com

Bradley Beal (LAC) → depth at the 2: Kris Dunn, Bogdan Bogdanović (plus guard redundancy with Harden/CP3). 
ESPN.com

Zion Williamson (NOP) → backups: Derik Queen, Saddiq Bey (Herb Jones can slide up; C help from Yves Missi/Kevon Looney). 
ESPN.com

LeBron James (LAL) → forwards behind him: Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura (plus Jake LaRavia minutes). 
ESPN.com
+1

Jamal Murray (DEN) → primary PG reserve: Bruce Brown (then Jalen Pickett). 
CBSSports.com

Kyrie Irving (DAL) → Mavericks’ ball-handler depth: D’Angelo Russell, Dante Exum (Kyrie listed out into early season on this chart). 
CBSSports.com

Lonzo Ball (CHI) → Bulls guard depth: Tre Jones, Jevon Carter (starters/rotations also include Josh Giddey, Coby White). 
ESPN.com
+1

Kristaps Porziņģis (recent lower-leg surgery history) → Status shifted this offseason; Celtics moved on from much of last year’s center depth (e.g., Luke Kornet). If you’re rostering Porziņģis elsewhere (or in drafts where he’s on BOS/ATL depending on your file set), plan secondary minutes via team’s current center options; the larger takeaway is his documented multi-year lower-leg soft-tissue risk. 
Reuters
+1

Quick drafting tip: when you take one of the above, queue their backup two-deep (e.g., Embiid → Bona/Drummond; Kawhi → Jones Jr./Batum) so you aren’t scrambling if the starter misses time.

Want me to cross-check this list against the latest current_draft_results.tsv (to ensure all backups are still available at your next pick) and then tailor a handcuff/stream plan for Round 15?

## Notes
Jalen Suggs may not be available for the season opener so I need his back up.

## Issues
- Your rotowire-nba-projections.csv looks like it has a BOM plus extra banner/header lines (and maybe embedded commas). We need a clean CSV that starts with one header row.
