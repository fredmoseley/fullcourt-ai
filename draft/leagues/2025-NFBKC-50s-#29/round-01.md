## decision
```json
{
  "pick_number": 6,
  "player_or_category": "Anthony Edwards",
  "rationale": "With the top 5 gone, Edwards is the best option. He’s an ascending superstar, durable (played 79 and 82 games last two years), and delivers strong points, threes, steals, and improving efficiency. He anchors guard scoring while leaving room to balance assists and rebounds in later rounds."
}
```

## prompts
```text
Who should I take with my first pick?

You have ignored the context that I have provided in my instructions. The current_draft_results.tsv contains the draft results to date.  It will tell you what players have been taken so far.  I cannot draft a player that has already been taken.  My team name is @kfredinccali.  I have the 6th pick in the first round.

## transcript
```text
Alternatives if you prefer different roster builds:
	•	Anthony Davis – Elite FG%, rebounds, and blocks, but bigger durability risk.
	•	Karl-Anthony Towns – Safer durability than AD, contributes threes, rebounds, and efficiency.
	•	Trae Young – FT%, assists, and scoring anchor, but more one-dimensional.

```

## notes
Ignored my current_draft_results.tsv file and selected Jokic as my first pick.  Need to modify my prompt.
